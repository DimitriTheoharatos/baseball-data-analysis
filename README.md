# baseball-data-analysis

This project serves as a data exploration into Major League Baseball data and statistics. 

It investigates the following questions using Python:
> 1.  Power hitters swing for the fences and are thus more likely to strike out.  Alternatively, contact hitters strike out less since they only focus on hitting the ball.  Does this widely accepted tenet of baseball hold true?

>2.   What pitching statistics make a starting pitcher most valuable over the past 30 years?

The data used to investigate these questions can be found at the following link:

This repository includes the datasets used in the exploration, as well as the Python notebook where you can follow along with the coding and analysis and finally the exported .html file.
