# Baseball Data Exploration

This project serves as a data exploration into Major League Baseball data and statistics. 

It investigates the following questions using Python:
> 1.  Power hitters swing for the fences and are thus more likely to strike out.  Alternatively, contact hitters strike out less since they only focus on hitting the ball.  Does this widely accepted tenet of baseball hold true?

>2.   What pitching statistics make a starting pitcher most valuable over the past 30 years?

This repository includes the datasets used in the exploration, as well as the Python notebook where you can follow along with the coding and analysis and finally the exported .html file.  

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)


### Files

`baseball_data_analysis.ipynb` --> Python notebook where the code is implemented

`baseballdatabank-2017.1` --> Folder containing the data used in the exploration

`baseball_data_analysis.html` --> Exported .html file from the Python notebook

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The dataset can be found here: http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/
